# Optimization-of-code-caves-in-malware-binaries-to-evade-Machine-Learning-detectors

These code has been tested on a system with Ubuntu 20.04.1 x64, using Python 3.8 and the following version of Radare2: radare2 4.5.0-git 0 @ linux-x86-64 git.4.5.0-git.

## Installation

Clone the project and install the packages included in requirements.txt:

```
git clone https://github.com/JavierYuste/Optimization-of-code-caves-in-malware-binaries-to-evade-Machine-Learning-detectors
cd Optimization-of-code-caves-in-malware-binaries-to-evade-Machine-Learning-detectors
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to run correctly, Radare2 must be installed in the system.
The pretrained MalConv model can be downloaded from https://github.com/elastic/ember

## Data

To ease reproducibility, we publish the [SHA256](./data/Dataset.xlsx) hash of the samples used in the experimentation.
